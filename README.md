# airline-employee-scheduling-system

This is a airline employee scheduling system that I worked on in the Spring 2023 semester. 
The website is built using PHP, OCI8, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQL Plus. 
It contains many various features:
- Different user experince for pilots, flight attendants, and admins
- Searching and querying flights
- Viewing flight information and requesting flights
- Current Schedule
- Inserting flights via CSV
- and much more!

The project was built on Apache and with an Oracle 11g Database. All other miscellaneous files have been removed for brevity.
The two main folders seen are build and html. 
build contains the necessary CSVs, SQL statements, and CTL files to create the entitys and relationships needed.
html contains the front-end code, including PHP and OCI8 to connect to the database created.

Here are some screenshots of the project:
