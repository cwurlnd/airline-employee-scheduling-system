# airline-employee-scheduling-system

This is a airline employee scheduling system that I worked on in the Spring 2023 semester. 
The website is built using PHP, OCI8, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQL Plus. 
It contains many various features:
- Searching and querying flights
- Viewing flight information and requesting flights
- Current Schedule
- Inserting flights via CSV
- and much more!
